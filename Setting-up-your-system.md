# Preparing your PC
## System Requirements
The system requirements are detailed within the Vivado User Guide UG973. To summarize, you are typically fine with:
* OS: Windows & Linux
* ~ 4GB of RAM
* ~ 100GB free storage 

## Installing Vivado
You can download the latest Vivado Design Suite version from [here](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html). During the installation process I recommend to choose the **Webpack** edition, which is free and includes the chipset required for this tutorial series. 

## Installing the Redpitaya-125-14 board files
To be able to generate your custom FPGA designs, it is recommended to use board files that preconfigures your Vivado design environment.
