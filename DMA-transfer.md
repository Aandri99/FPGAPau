## About this tutorial
:stopwatch: 45 min

**Key learnings:**

* Long custom waveform generation generation/acquisition.

* PL (Programable Logic): use AXI DMA IP for reading/writing data from/to RAM memory.

* PS (Processing System): use PYNQ for reading/writing data from/to RAM memory.

**Description:** 

FPGAs have typically very low on-chip memory resources (~250kB for the ZYNQ-7010 of your Redpitaya-125-14). This limitation is circumvented through one (or several) external DDR memories which are connected to the FPGA through high bandwidth ports and controlled through a Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine. The Redpitaya-125-14 includes a 512MB DDR memory, which serves as RAM for the Zynq PS but can also be used to exchange data with the Zynq PL. 

In this tutorial we are going to build a dual channel data acquisition and generation design, where the samples are directly read form (written to) RAM memory via DMA. A PYNQ Jupyter Notebook will be used to preload a waveform to RAM memory for waveform generation, simultaneously trigger the waveform generation/acquisition and plot the acquired samples.

## Building the Vivado Design
### Create a new Vivado Project
Follow the steps in [LED blink](https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/wiki/LED-blink#create-a-new-vivado-project) and use *DMA_transfer* as the new project name. 

### Import the Redpitaya-125-14 IP library
Follow the steps in [Analog echo](https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/wiki/Analog-echo#import-the-redpitaya-125-14-ip-library).

### Block Design
* Create a new block design.
* Create an instance of the following IPs:
    * ZYNQ7 Processing System
    * Processor System Reset
    * AXI GPIO
    * AXI Interconnect (x2)
    * AXI Direct Memory Access (x2)
    * Redpitaya-125-14-clk
    * Redpitaya-125-14-adc
    * Redpitaya-125-14-dac
* Double click on the ZYNQ7 instance and go to *HP Slave AXI Interface* and enable the high performance interfaces *S AXI HP0 interface* and *S AXI HP1 interface* (data width 64 bit).

* (x2) Double click on the AXI Interconnect instance and configure it to have 2 Slave Interfaces and 1 Master Interface.

* Connect the clocks and resets.

### AXI stream control module

We need a simple HDl module that controls the controls the data streams going into / out of the DMA engines. The main functionality is:
* Hold the incoming/outgoing data streams until a trigger signal is received.
* Rise the AXI stream *tlast* line, when the last data sample gets acquired.

To include a stream control module please follow the steps below:
* Within the left panel go to *Project Manager --> Add sources* and select  *Add or create design sources*.
* Import [FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/hdl/stream_ctrl.vhd](https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/hdl/stream_ctrl.vhd).
* (x4) Add the stream control module to your design (right-click on the design and select *Add Module*) and draw the required connections.
   * *stream_i* / *stream_o* -->  as highlighted in diagram below.
   * *clk* / *resetn* -->  similar to the already instantiated logic, they are connected to *clk_125* and *peripheral_aresetn*.
   * *trig* --> AXI GPIO Channel 1.
   * *samples* --> AXI GPIO Channel 2.

### Connect the MM2S and S2MM interfaces
* We have to connect the DMA memory-mapped-to-stream (MM2S) and stream-to-memory-mapped (S2MM) to the ZYNQ HP ports via AXI Interconnect instances. To this end, draw the following connections:

### Constraints and port creation
* Edit the constraints in *redpitaya-125-14.xdc* and uncomment the sections:
  * ADC (lines 8-56)
  * DAC (lines 59-90)
  * Clock constraints (lines 180-183)

* Go back to your design and create the required input/output ports for the *Redpitaya-125-14-clk*, *Redpitaya-125-14-adc* and *Redpitaya-125-14-dac* IPs. The fastest way is to right-click on a every port and choose *Create Port*  (*CTRL + K*) and proceed with the default settings. 

* Including all the required ports, the design becomes:

### Block and connection automation.
* Use the *Block Automation* (green field above your design) to route the DDR and FIXED_IO ports. It is important to **uncheck the *Apply Board Board Preset* **, otherwise we will have to enable again the HP ports.
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/DMA-transfer/block_automation.PNG" width="600"/>


* Run *Connection Automation* (green field above your design) to interconnect the AXI GPIO and ZYNQ instances.

* The final design becomes

### Address Editor
* Open the Address Editor and automatically assign an address space to all interfaces (right-click on on *Network 0* and select *Assign All*)
