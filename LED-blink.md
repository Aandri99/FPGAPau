## About this tutorial 
:stopwatch: 30 min

**Key learnings:**

* Create a new Vivado project & block design

* Use the AXI GPIO to write data from PS to PL

* Write custom HDL modules

* Define board constraints

* Create a simple Jupyter Notebook to control the FPGA design

**Description**:

In this tutorial we are going to demonstrate how to blink the LEDs of your Redpitaya-124-14. The LEDs will be driven by the most-significant-bit (MSB) of a counter that continuously overflows. The counter is implemented within the Programable Logic (PL) and controlled through a simple PYQN Jupyter Notebook running on the Processing System (PS).

<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/projectSummary.PNG" width="1000"/>

### Create a new Block Design

* Create a new block design by clicking on *Create Block Design* (left panel). The design name will default to *design_1*.
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/createBlockDesign.PNG" width="1000"/>

* Right-click on the blank design and select *Add IP* to instantiate:
    * ZYNQ 7 Processing System
    * AXI GPIO (we will use this IP to write from PS to PL)
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/zynqGpio_1.PNG" width="1000"/>

* Click on *Run Block Automation* (green field above your design) to route the DDR and FIXED_IO ports of the ZYNQ instance. To this end, leave the configuration window in its default state.
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/blockAutomation.PNG" width="450"/>
  
* Click on *Run Connection Automation* (green field above your design) to create the required clocking, reset and AXI interconnect infrastructure. To this end, within the configuration window only select *S_AXI*. We do not select *GPIO*, because we will manually configure & connect the AXI GPIO.
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/connectionAutomation.PNG" width="450"/>

* After running block & connection automation, the design becomes:
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/zynqGpio_2.PNG" width="1000"/>

* Double-click on the AXI GPIO instance and enable Channel 1 and Channel 2 as outputs of 1 and 32 bits, respectively. Later in the design process, we will use Channel 1 to reset the counter logic and Channel 2 to define the counter increment value. 
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/axiGpio.PNG" width="450"/>

* Double-click on the ZYNQ instance and verify (under *Clock Configuration --> PL Fabric Clocks*) that *FCLK_CLK0* is enabled and set to 50 MHz.

### Create an HDL counter
***

:information_source: A ready-to-use HDL counter is available under [FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/hdl/counter.vhd](https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/hdl/counter.vhd). 

***
* The next step is to create a counter logic with variable counter increment. Click on *Add Sources* (left panel) and select *Add or create design sources*.
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/addSourceVivado.PNG" width="450"/>

* At this point you can either select and already existing HDL file or create a new one. We will follow the latter.
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/newSource.PNG" width="450"/>

* Define the module ports (they can also be changed later, within the HDL code).
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/defineModule.PNG" width="350"/>

* The new source file (*counter.vhd*) will be added to the project source tree. 
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/counterVhd.PNG" width="1000"/>

* Edit *counter.vhd* to include the counter logic (see [FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/hdl/counter.vhd](https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/hdl/counter.vhd) for a working example).

* Add the HDL counter module to your design. To this end, right-click on the design and select *Add Module*.
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/addModule.PNG" width="220"/>



### Constraints and signal routing
* Open the constraints file (*redpitaya-125-14.xdc*) and uncomment lines 166-177, which define and configure the FPGA ports connected to the LEDs.
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/ledSdc.PNG" width="1000"/>

* Return to your design, right-click and select *Create Port*. Name the port *led_o* and configure it as shown below:
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/createPort.PNG" width="300"/>

* Now we need to connect the MSB of the HDL counter to the output port. For this purpose, instantiate:
   * Slice IP
   * Concat IP

* Configure the Slice IP to accept a 32 bit wide input and return the MSB.
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/slice.PNG" width="450"/>

* Configure the Concat IP to bundle 8 inputs (1 bit wide).
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/concat.PNG" width="450"/>

* Wire up the AXI GPIO, HDL counter, Slice IP, Concat IP and *led_o* port as shown below:
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/fullDesign.PNG" width="1000"/>

### Bitstream generation

* Before bitstream generation, a HDL wrapper around the design needs to be created. Within your project source tree, right-click on top of your design  and select *Create HDL Wrapper* (use default settings).
<img src="https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists/blob/main/doc/LED-blink/hdlWrapper.PNG" width="1000"/>


* Click on *Generate Bitstream* (left panel) and proceed with the default settings. This will automatically take you through:
     * **Synthesis**: translates the custom design FPGA design into logical elements such as flip-flops, LUTs...
     * **Implementation**: places the logical elements of the synthesized design into the particular chip architecture.
     * **Bitstream generation**: creates a binary image that contains the implemented design.

* After a few minutes, the process completes. Press *Cancel* to close the pop-up window.
